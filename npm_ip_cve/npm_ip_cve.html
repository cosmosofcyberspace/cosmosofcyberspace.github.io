<h1>Missing IP Address Control in isPublic() Function Leads to SSRF Bypass PoC</h1>
<pre>
<b><Software: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip</b>
<b>Version: <= 1.1.8(Latest)</b>
<b>Fixed Version: None </b>
<b>CVE ID: CVE-2023-42282</b>
<b>Vulnerability Type: Security Misconfiguration</b>

    

<b>Vulnerabilty: Missing IP Address Control in isPublic() Function Leads to SSRF Bypass</b>
<h3>Description of the product:</h3>
IP address utilities for node.js
Get your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.</br>

    
<h3>Description of the vulnerability:</h3>
In the code snippet of library, a security vulnerability arises due to the ip.isPublic function's incorrect identification of the IP address 0x7f.1 as public.</br>
This address is actually a hexadecimal representation of the private IP 127.0.0.1. </br>
This misclassification can lead to potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as the code may unintentionally permit HTTP requests to internal network resources, creating a significant security risk.</br> 
The core issue is the function's failure to accurately distinguish between public and private IP addresses.</br>
</br>

    
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
The root cause of this vulnerability is the ip.isPublic function's inability to correctly interpret and classify certain IP address representations. </br>
Specifically, the function fails to recognize 0x7f.1 as a private IP address, which is actually a hexadecimal and shorthand notation for 127.0.0.1, a well-known loopback address.</br>
This misinterpretation leads to the function erroneously categorizing a private IP as public, thereby opening up the potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. </br>
The core issue lies in the inadequate handling of non-standard IP address formats by the IP address validation mechanism.</br>
    
<h3>PoC:</h3>
 <code>
        <br>var ip = require('ip');</br>
        <br>console.log(ip.isPublic("0x7f.1")); // true</br>
        <br>// Check IP and IF IP is not public do HTTP req ==> SSRF</br>
        <br>var my_ip = "0x7f.1"; // private but ip package doesn't recognize as private!</br>
        <br>// var my_ip2 = "google.com"; // public --> fetch will be completed</br>
        <br>// var my_ip3 = "127.0.0.1"; // private --> else statement will be run</br>
        <br>if (ip.isPublic(my_ip)) {</br>
            <br>fetch("http://" + my_ip).then((response) => {</br>
                <br>console.log(response);</br>
            <br>});</br>
        <br>} else {</br>
            <br>console.log("IP is not public");</br>
        <br>}</br>
 </code>
    </br>

<h3>Impact:</h3>
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. </br>
SSRF attacks occur when an attacker is able to induce a server to make requests to internal resources, which the attacker normally couldn't access directly. </br>
In this case, the misclassification of 0x7f.1 as a public IP address allows for unintended internal network requests. </br>
This could potentially expose sensitive information, interact with internal services, or exploit vulnerabilities within the network. </br>
Additionally, such vulnerabilities can be leveraged to perform port scanning, gain unauthorized access, or as part of a larger attack chain. </br>
The risk is heightened in environments where the server has access to critical internal systems.</br>
